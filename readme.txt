The SimpleShop WP plugin easily connects your WordPress website with a SimpleShop account and allows you to restrict the access to the web content only for members.

== Description ==

The SimpleShop WP plugin can be installed on a WordPress website with WP version 4.6 and higher or on a Mioweb website,
which does not contain its own member sections. The compatible version of PHP is 5.6.20 and higher.

To ensure correct functionality of the plugin, we always recommend to update to the newest version of the plugin.

=== Functions ===

==== Member sections ====

The SimpleShop WordPress plugin is primarily used to create and manage member sections on your website. Creating users and granting access to the right content is ensured by communication with the SimpleShop sales system, where it is necessary to have your own account.

You can register for a SimpleShop account at: [https://app.simpleshop.cz/account/create/](https://app.simpleshop.cz/account/create/)

The SimpleShop WordPress plugin is compatible with the WordPress editor (Gutenberg).

==== Inserting a sales form ====

The second area of use of the plugin is to insert a sales form created in the SimpleShop into your website. Again, you must have your own account in the SimpleShop system.
